Evaluation of Recurrent Neural Networks for Detecting Injections in API Requests 

Machine learning Model Project.
Developed a machine learning model that helps us to detecting the Injections in API Request. The objective of this
study is to analyze incoming requests to a target API and flag any malicious activity and proposes a solution using 
sequence models to identify whether or not an API request has SQL, XML, JSON, and other types of malicious injections. 
This study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in detecting injection attacks within API requests. 
RNNs have shown promise in capturing sequential dependencies, making them suitable candidates for analyzing the sequential nature of API requests. 
The evaluation involves training and testing RNN models using datasets containing both benign and malicious API requests. Various architectures of RNNs, 
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), are explored to determine their performance in accurately identifying injection attempts.
